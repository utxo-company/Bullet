  abstract: [
    This paper introduces a novel approach to account abstraction on utxo ledger based blockchains. We present a set of smart contracts that abstract the ownership of an address to a quorum of keys stored in a UTxO. Our results show increased security along with new wallet features for more efficient DeFi usage.
